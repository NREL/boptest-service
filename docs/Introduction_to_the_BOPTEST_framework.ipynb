Following the workshop, users are invited to continue using BOPTEST with a version meant for usage on a user's own (local) device.  Both the web-based and local versions have the same functionality, and will produce the same results, with only small changes in the API.

For our selected test case `bestest_hydronic_heat_pump`, testing scenario time periods are available that each last for two weeks, with a one week warm-up period.  These periods represent either peak heating or typical heating.  Note for test cases that also utilize cooling systems, scanerio time periods for peak cooling, typical cooling, and mixed heating and cooling are also available.  In addition to the time period, a testing scenario is also defined by an electricity price profile.  For all available test cases, the available electricity price profiles represent constant, dynamic, or highly dynamic conditions.  A dynamic price profile follows something like a day-night or time-of-use tariff, while a highly dynamic price profile follows something like a wholesale electricity market for the building's location.  Note that for our selected test case `bestest_hydronic_heat_pump`, the price profiles include a constant offset for transportation fees and taxes such that realistic pricing is used.
